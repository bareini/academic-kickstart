# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "In this study we propose a novel method of “removing” known, hand-engineered features from the network’s hypothesis space, thus forcing it to try learn representations which are different from known ones, as a method of scientific exploration. We then build on existing work in the field of interpretability, specifically class activation maps, to try infer what new features the network has learned."
